# Fake_news_prediction-
A fake news prediction model using logistic regression classifies news articles as fake or real. This involves several steps to ensure accurate predictions:

Key Components
Data Collection:

Gather articles from credible and fake news sources.
Label each article as "fake" or "real."
Preprocessing:

Text Cleaning: Remove punctuation, stop words, and apply stemming/lemmatization.
Feature Extraction:
TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency): Convert text into numerical vectors.

Logistic Regression: Chosen for its simplicity, interpretability, and effectiveness.
Regularization: Techniques like L2 prevent overfitting.
Evaluation:

Train-Test Split: Divide the dataset for evaluation in 80 : 20
Metrics: Assess using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC.
Prediction:

The model predicts the probability of an article being fake or real, classifying it accordingly.
Deployment:

Deploy as a web service or integrate into platforms for real-time predictions, flagging articles for review.
Advantages and Challenges
Advantages:

Interpretability: Coefficients provide insights into feature importance.
Simplicity: Easy to implement and efficient.
Effectiveness: Performs well in binary classification tasks.
Challenges:

Feature Selection: Crucial for accuracy.
Data Quality: Performance depends on the training data's quality and diversity.
Evolving Nature of Fake News: Requires regular updates with new data.
